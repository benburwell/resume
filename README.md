Ben Burwell's Resume
--------------------

You've found the source code for my resume! I decided to create it in LaTeX because:

* LaTeX is designed to create beautiful documents;
* LaTeX is text-based, perfect for storing in git;
* It's easy to update.

### Prerequisites

Compiling my resume assumes that you have a LaTeX installation on your system. You should be able to get what you need by running

    $ apt-get install texlive-full

### Compiling

    $ make
